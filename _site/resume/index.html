            Hello there! If you're looking for my resume, this page has my in-depth and entire working history -- and is mostly here for me to
            keep track of the various jobs/experiences that I've had!
            <br>
            But I realize that not everyone is here for that, so here is a single page version. And please feel free to visit my LinkedIn page,
            as it gets updated the most frequently.

            August 2023 - Currently in Leave of Absence </h3> 
          <p class="lead">
            I returned to the same lab that I worked in the previous years in order to continue projects, such as the nanogel-related
            project, which was recently submitted to Science for review. And began various projects involving neuro-cancer interaction.
            <br>
            Currently, I am taking a break from the lab in order to explore the world and find a way persue a more creative outlet for
            my love of research.

                June 2022 - May 2023 </h3> 
              <p class="lead">
                  Following graduation from Georgia Tech, I continued my work on research with Dr. Travis Rotterman 
                  on muscle spindle regeneration in rodent models at the Cope Lab (located at Georgia Tech). 
                  I also worked on the potassium ion channel, Kv3.3, with Dr. Nick Housley, and studied the ion 
                  channel's role in synaptic firing, through siRNA treatments, as well as, visualization 
                  of protein expression through immunohistochemistry staining. And began a project involving the application of
                  nanogels (also can be known as nanoparticles) in cancer treatments.
                  <br>
                  During this time, I was an author on a paper in the Journal of Experimental Physiology!

            May 2021 - May 2022 </h3> 
          <p class="lead">
            Working on research regarding muscle spindle regeneration in rodent models at the Cope Lab (located at Georgia Tech), 
            and reports directly to Dr. Travis Rotterman and Dr. Timothy Cope. My responsibilities include using a cyrostat to cut muscle,
            perform immunohistochemistry experiments to locate muscle spindles and the extent of axon regeneration, as well as,
            using a confocal microscope in order to image and analyze muscle spindles and the amount axon regeneration in the muscles. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I got into this research due to my fascination of the regeneration of the central nervous system, 
            specifically the spinal cord.
