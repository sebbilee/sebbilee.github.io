          <p class="lead">
            Hello there! I'm Sebbi, I recently graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Neuroscience! I love combining art with my
            love of research, but am always looking to try to fix everyday inconveniences!
            <br>
            <br>
            Even though I'm currently in graduate school for Applied Physiology, I'm still looking to persue a career path where I can combine
            all of my favorite things: research, technology, and design.
            <br>
            But on the side, I have always been motivated by a desire to increase accessibility of technology for those with disabilities,
            as many family members of mine suffer from varying levels of permanent disabilities. Although not as permenant, I have 
            been suffering from an overuse injury in my wrist which has caused a decreases in the range of motion, and has it has made the
            simplest tasks, like opening my own water bottle difficult. 
            <br>
            And like many people, I suffer from astigmatism, which has led me to look for alternatives to dark mode, as I
            have been struggling to read while using the feature.

              I returned to the same lab that I worked in the previous years in order to continue projects, such as the nanogel-related
              project, which was recently submitted to Science for review. And have begun various projects involving neuro-cancer interaction.
              <br>
              Despite my 'day job', I spend my freetime working on some more creative projects.

                <p class="lead">
                    Following graduation from Georgia Tech, I continued my work on research with Dr. Travis Rotterman 
                    on muscle spindle regeneration in rodent models at the Cope Lab (located at Georgia Tech). 
                    I also worked on the potassium ion channel, Kv3.3, with Dr. Nick Housley, and studied the ion 
                    channel's role in synaptic firing, through siRNA treatments, as well as, visualization 
                    of protein expression through immunohistochemistry staining. And began a project involving the application of
                    nanogels (or commonly known as nanoparticles) in cancer treatments.
                    <br>
                    During this time, I was an author on a paper in the Journal of Experimental Physiology!

              Working on research regarding muscle spindle regeneration in rodent models at the Cope Lab (located at Georgia Tech), 
              and reports directly to Dr. Travis Rotterman and Dr. Timothy Cope. My responsibilities include using a cyrostat to cut muscle,
              perform immunohistochemistry experiments to locate muscle spindles and the extent of axon regeneration, as well as,
              using a confocal microscope in order to image and analyze muscle spindles and the amount axon regeneration in the muscles. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I got into this research due to my fascination of the regeneration of the central nervous system, 
              specifically the spinal cord.
